### 2019 - San Francisco

This last edition was hosted by the city of San Francisco, more precisely the San Francisco Cultural Center. A format very different from the previous ones was proposed. We decided to address the event to a public in search of deepening new forms and processes related to juggling. We reduced the attendance to a cap of 25 participants to experiment with a format more similar to a retreat. We convened 10 seminarians, 20 artists and a pedagogical schedule of 70 hours. Lecturers and leading artists from Argentina and neighboring countries participated. We managed to maintain close ties in other conventions and the attention of producers who are still betting on the project.
