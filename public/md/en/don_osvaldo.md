Accompaniment of the cultural center and popular library la escuelita:

This year we have the support of the cultural space and popular library La Escuelita who have been with us since the beginning in the management of CAM22. It is made up of a group of neighbors who have been meeting since the beginning of 2015 to carry out cultural activities in a ministry of education building ceded to this group. In 2016 the town's library joined this space and from there they built together what today is a nucleus of cultural concentration. It is part of the community living culture network of the east of the Province of Córdoba, it is a culture point of the nation's culture ministry and it has the radio "others of us" with daily programming.
