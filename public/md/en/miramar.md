Miramar is located some 197 kilometers north of the City of Córdoba. It is possible to take the NR 19 just passing Río Primero, then take the PR 10 and finally PR 17. One can also take the "Fonobus".

It is avowed to be the only riverside town in the banks of Mar Chiquita Lagoon. The sun falls on the shore between herons, seagulls and pink flamingos.

Besides beach and waterfront, it offers several museums and geological and historical sites.

The Mar Chiquita Lagoon is one of the biggest saline wetlands in the world. Thus, the area encompasses a unique biodiversity (more than 300 wildlife species accounted for). As the distances are small, its waterfront is chosen for strolls and biking.
