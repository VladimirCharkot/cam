### 2016 - Río Cuarto

In 2016, the first CAM took place, with a strong commitment to education and training. Itwas organized at the “National University of Rio Cuarto” (UNRC) with an concurrence of 130 attendees, 15 teachers, 4 nights of shows and 100 hours of artistic training. We had the visit of participants from 15 Argentine provinces. It marked a precedent in the juggler population that had never experienced an event like this.
