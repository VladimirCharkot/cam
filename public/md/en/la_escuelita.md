## The place — La Escuelita

The Cultural Space and Pop Library "La Escuelita", who will be our host, is formed by a group of neighbours who from 2015 onward get together to carry out cultural activities in a building granted by the ministry of education.

It hosts a big amount of artistic and educative activities in which the Miramar's and neighbouring towns' communities participate. In 2016 the town's library joins the project and from then on build together what it is today a true cultural concentration core. Not only projects are propeled from the space itself but also deportive groups and even the municipality find room in this nest to enhance their projects and take in the human warmth that this wondrous group of people emanates.

It takes part in the alive cultural community network in the eastern Provincia de Córdoba, it is a culture point in the nation's culture ministry and hosts [the radio "otros nosotros"](http://otrosnosotrosradio.com.ar/) ("another us", roughly) with daily schedule.

The Escuelita is perpetual call to the cultural labor.
