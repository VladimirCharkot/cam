## ðŸŽ‰ Â¡The fourth AJC is coming! ðŸŽ‰
## April 19th to 24th, 2022, Miramar, CÃ³rdoba

Â¡Once again juggling brings us together for a week full of workshops, seminars, shows, friends, feasts and circus!

The _Argentinian Juggling Convention_ returns reloaded, and we're already planning, arranging and articulating so it's a reunion party.

The scenario will be _Miramar de Ansenuza_, CÃ³rdoba, right next to the Mar Chiquita lagoon. There we'll be hosted by the _"La Escuelita" Cultural Space_. The date, _April 19th to 24th_.

Once again the convention's focus will be on education. **Seminar applications are open**. If you've got a proposal, [Â¡let us know!](https://forms.gle/Siopo6FwKsaT1oMh7)

This year we'll be collaborating with the [A-Nido Collective](https://colectivoanido.com) for the making of the educational program. We're looking forward to organize themed lines for the seminars (technique, research, scene, etc...)

We're also articulating with Litoral Circus, who are going to take care of community, networking and broadcasting, and Santuanime, who will manage show applications and organization. We're Cuete and Luci, from La Parlota Circus, in the general organization.

We'll let you know what's up on this side by means of our social media and this very site.

Â¡Our hearts are seething in joy! Â¡The _Conve_ is back! Â¡Wooooo!

We'll be waiting with zest
